Welcome to the ChemML's documentation!
======================================
ChemML is a machine learning and informatics program suite for the analysis, mining, and modeling of chemical and materials data.

    - source: https://github.com/hachmannlab/chemml
    - documentation: https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemml

Code Design:
++++++++++++
ChemML is developed in the Python 3 programming language and makes use of a host of data analysis and ML libraries(accessible through the Anaconda distribution), as well as domain-specific libraries.
The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible.

The format of library is similar to the well known libraries like Scikit-learn. ChemML is also available
via graphical user interface provided by [ChemEco](https://github.com/hachmannlab/chemeco).
ChemEco is a general-purpose framework for data mining without coding. It also interfaces with many of the libraries that supply methods for the
representation, preprocessing, analysis, mining, and modeling of large-scale chemical data sets.

Version:
++++++++
- Program Version: 0.5.1
- Release Date: April 2, 2019

Installation and Dependencies:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can download ChemML from Python Package Index (PyPI) via pip.

.. code:: bash

    pip install chemml --user -U

Here is a list of external libraries that will be installed with chemml:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - tensorflow
   - keras
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - lxml

Since conda installation is not available for ChemML yet, we recommend installing rdkit and openbabel in a conda virtual environment prior to
installing ChemML. For doing so, you need to follow the conda installer:

.. code:: bash

    conda create --name my_chemml_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemml_env
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
    conda install -c rdkit rdkit
    pip install chemml

Python 2 Fans:
++++++++++++++

The library was initially compatible with Python 2 and 3, and we still develop compatible codes. However, since the Python community
and some of the dependencies are phasing out support for Python 2, we also removed it from the classifier languages.
However, you should still be able to clone the ChemML repository from github and install the older versions of some of the dependencies that
support Python 2 prior to using ChemML locally.
